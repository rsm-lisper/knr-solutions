Improvements

    Major performance improvements: reduced startup time, faster video loading, faster project loading
    Full resolution preview is now enabled by default, uses zero-copy pipeline
    Added video speed control (which can also be keyframed) and it adjusts the stabilization to the speed change
    Added CLI interface: Can render, open file in GUI, export project, watch folder and stabilize new videos. [see here]
    When dropping multiple files, Gyroflow now asks if you want to join them or add to render queue
    Added GoPro Hero 11 support (official lens profiles, autoboost mode. Hyperview is not accurate yet)
    Added support for zoom lenses, and zoom can be changing throughout the video (Sony cameras) [see here]
    Loading gyro data from BRAW files is now much faster
    Added a way to create a default settings preset (put default.gyroflow in camera_presets) which will be applied to every loaded video
    Added zooming amount to the chart and renamed XYZ buttons to RPY (roll, pitch, yaw)
    Increased max rendering resolution to 8192x8192
    Merge .gcsv files when merging video files
    Added jpg to detected image sequences
    Added spectrum analyzer for gyro/accl data (mostly for diagnostics)
    Updated icon on Windows
