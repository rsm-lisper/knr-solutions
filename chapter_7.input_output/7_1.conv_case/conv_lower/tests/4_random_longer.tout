    dave wasn't exactly sure how he had ended up in this predicament. he ran through all the events that had lead to this current situation and it still didn't make sense. he wanted to spend some time to try and make sense of it all, but he had higher priorities at the moment. the first was how to get out of his current situation of being naked in a tree with snow falling all around and no way for him to get down.
    it's always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike. if you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't have to worry. only the slowest in the group do. that was the lesson they were about to learn that day.
    she was in a hurry. not the standard hurry when you're in a rush to get someplace, but a frantic hurry. the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death. she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars. she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead.
    was it enough? that was the question he kept asking himself. was being satisfied enough? he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal. he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasn't going to be enough.
    have you ever wondered about toes? why 10 toes and not 12. why are some bigger than others? some people can use their toes to pick up things while others can barely move them on command. some toes are nice to look at while others are definitely not something you want to look at. toes can be stubbed and make us scream. toes help us balance and walk. 10 toes are just something to ponder.
    finding the truth wouldn't be easy, that's for sure. then there was the question of whether or not jane really wanted to know the truth. that's the thing that bothered her most. it wasn't the difficulty of actually finding out what happened that was the obstacle, but having to live with that information once it was found.
    betty was a creature of habit and she thought she liked it that way. that was until dave showed up in her life. she now had a choice to make and it would determine whether her lie remained the same or if it would change forever.
    she patiently waited for his number to be called. she had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. she's resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go. mom tended to be that way. she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. so, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.
    the red line moved across the page. with each millimeter it advanced forward, something changed in the room. the actual change taking place was difficult to perceive, but the change was real. the red line continued relentlessly across the page and the room would never be the same.
    he couldn't remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he had. the fact that she didn't believe him was quite frustrating as he began to search the internet to find the article. it wasn't as if it was something that seemed impossible. yet she insisted on always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact.
    the headache wouldn't go away. she's taken medicine but even that didn't help. the monstrous throbbing in her head continued. she had this happen to her only once before in her life and she realized that only one thing could be happening.
    there wasn't a bird in the sky, but that was not what caught her attention. it was the clouds. the deep green that isn't the color of clouds, but came with these. she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared.
    he scolded himself for being so tentative. he knew he shouldn't be so cautious, but there was a sixth sense telling him that things weren't exactly as they appeared. it was that weird chill that rolls up your neck and makes the hair stand on end. he knew that being so tentative could end up costing him the job, but he learned that listening to his sixth sense usually kept him from getting into a lot of trouble.
    what were they eating? it didn't taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished, she didn't dare ask. she knew the answer would be one she didn't want to hear.
    out of another, i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. he says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. so i try.
    green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy. ants used the vine as their private highway, avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark, to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore. at least this was the way it was supposed to be. something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway.
    the river slowly meandered through the open space. it had hidden secrets that it didn't want to reveal. it had a well-planned strategy to appear calm, inviting, and appealing. that's how the river lured her unknowing victims to her water's edge.
    there was a leak in the boat. nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would for the next couple of hours. this was a problem since the boat was heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it would be much larger when it was ultimately discovered. john had planned it exactly this way.
    there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming. in his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless. that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone.
    there was a time and a place for stephanie to use her magic. the problem was that she had a difficult time determining this. she wished she could simply use it when the desire hit and there wouldn't be any unforeseen consequences. unfortunately, that's not how it worked and the consequences could be devastating if she accidentally used her magic at the wrong time.
    cake or pie? i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick. it may seem silly, but cake people and pie people are really different. i know which one i hope you are, but that's not for me to decide. so, what is it? cake or pie?
    it was a weird concept. why would i really need to generate a random paragraph? could i actually learn something from doing so? all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button. to her surprise, she found what she least expected to see.
    sometimes it's simply better to ignore the haters. that's the lesson that tom's dad had been trying to teach him, but tom still couldn't let it go. he latched onto them and their hate and couldn't let it go, but he also realized that this wasn't healthy. that's when he came up with his devious plan.
    with six children in tow, catherine raced to the airport departing gate. this wasn't an easy task as the children had other priorities than to get to the gate. she knew that she was tight on time and the frustration came out as she yelled at the kids to keep up. they continued to test her, pretending not to listen and to move in directions that only slowed them down. they had no idea the wrath they were about to receive when catherine made it to the gate only to be informed that they had all missed the plane.
    the kids were loud. they were way too loud for jerry, especially since this was a four-hour flight. the parents didn't seem to be able, or simply didn't want, to control them. they were yelling and fighting among themselves and it was impossible for any of the passengers to concentrate or rest. he thought about politely tapping on the parents' shoulders and asking them to try and get their kids under a bit more control, but before he did he came up with a better idea. sure, it was a bit sinister, and he'd probably end p in a lot of trouble, but he really didn't care at that point.
    sleep deprivation causes all sorts of challenges and problems. when one doesn’t get enough sleep one’s mind doesn’t work clearly. studies have shown that after staying awake for 24 hours one’s ability to do simple math is greatly impaired. driving tired has been shown to be as bad as driving drunk. moods change, depression, anxiety, and mania can be induced by lack of sleep. as much as people try to do without enough sleep it is a wonder more crazy things don’t happen in this world.
    they argue. while the argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same. yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. they both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. so they continue to argue.
    the water rush down the wash and into the slot canyon below. two hikers had started the day to sunny weather without a cloud in the sky, but they hadn't thought to check the weather north of the canyon. huge thunderstorms had brought a deluge o rain and produced flash floods heading their way. the two hikers had no idea what was coming.
    the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. the next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. the third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. when it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever.
    he hid under the covers hoping that nobody would notice him there. it really didn't make much sense since it would be obvious to anyone who walked into the room there was someone hiding there, but he still held out hope. he heard footsteps coming down the hall and stop in front in front of the bedroom door. he heard the squeak of the door hinges and someone opened the bedroom door. he held his breath waiting for whoever was about to discover him, but they never did.
    twenty-five years dana had been waiting. she tried to be patient during that time but she hadn't always managed to be as patient as she'd like. but today the opportunity had finally come. the thing she always imagined would make her the happiest person in the world was about to happen. she didn't know why at this specific time she all of a sudden felt sick inside.
    the coin hovered in the air, spinning over and over again. it reached its peak and began to descend. both boys were pleading with it to land a certain way but the coin had already made up its mind on what it was going to do.
    there was something special about this little creature. donna couldn't quite pinpoint what it was, but she knew with all her heart that it was true. it wasn't a matter of if she was going to try and save it, but a matter of how she was going to save it. she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone.
    bryan had made peace with himself and felt comfortable with the choices he made. this had made all the difference in the world. being alone no longer bothered him and this was essential since there was a good chance he might spend the rest of his life alone in a cell.
    there weren't supposed to be dragons flying in the sky. first and foremost, dragons didn't exist. they were mythical creatures from fantasy books like unicorns. this was something that pete knew in his heart to be true so he was having a difficult time acknowledging that there were actually fire-breathing dragons flying in the sky above him.
    all he could think about was how it would all end. there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics were there for anyone to see. no matter how much he tried to see the positive, it wasn't anywhere to be seen. the end was coming and it wasn't going to be pretty.
    i haven't bailed on writing. look, i'm generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track. i am making an effort. i will start writing consistently again!
    "do not enter." the sign made it clear that they didn't want anyone around. that wasn't going to stop jack. jack always lived with the notion that signs were mere suggestions, not actually absolute rules. that's why the moment jack looked at the "do not enter" sign, he walked past it and onto their property.
    there are different types of secrets. she had held onto plenty of them during her life, but this one was different. she found herself holding onto the worst type. it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didn't tell someone about it, but it could end up getting you killed if you did.
    hopes and dreams were dashed that day. it should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. that was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.
    the paper was blank. it shouldn't have been. there should have been writing on the paper, at least a paragraph if not more. the fact that the writing wasn't there was frustrating. actually, it was even more than frustrating. it was downright distressing.
    her breath exited her mouth in big puffs as if she were smoking a cigarette. the morning dew had made her clothes damp and she shivered from the chill in the air. there was only one thing that could get her up and out this early in the morning.
    terrance knew that sometimes it was simply best to stay out of it. he kept repeating this to himself as he watched the scene unfold. he knew that nothing good would come of him getting involved. it was far better for him to stay on the sidelines and observe. he kept yelling this to himself inside his head as he walked over to the couple and punched the man in the face.
    frank knew there was a correct time and place to reveal his secret and this wasn't it. the issue was that the secret might be revealed despite his best attempt to keep it from coming out. at this point, it was out of his control and completely dependant on those around him who also knew the secret. they wouldn't purposely reveal it, or at least he believed that, but they could easily inadvertently expose it. it was going to be a long hour as he nervously eyed everyone around the table hoping they would keep their mouths shut.
    it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true. there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project. as she woke, she realized she was once again at a crossroads. would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream? dana rose and took her first step.
    she nervously peered over the edge. she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful, but all she felt was fear. there had always been something about heights that disturbed her, and now she could feel the full force of this unease. she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build. she couldn't help but feel that something horrible was about to happen.
    it really didn't matter what they did to him. he's already made up his mind. whatever came his way, he was prepared for the consequences. he knew in his heart that the sacrifice he made was done with love and not hate no matter how others decided to spin it.
    the trees, therefore, must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them, deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious. at that, they probably didn't have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land. and if that were true, there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden.
    the house was located at the top of the hill at the end of a winding road. it wasn't obvious that the house was there, but everyone in town knew that it existed. they were just all too afraid to ever go and see it in person.
    there was a reason for her shyness. everyone assumed it had always been there but she knew better. she knew the exact moment that the shyness began. it had been that fateful moment at the lake. there are just some events that do that to you.
