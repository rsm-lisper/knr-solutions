Exercise 3. Write a function expand(s1,s2) that expands shorthand notations like abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz in
the string s1 into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2. Allow for letters of either case
and digits, and be prepared to handle cases like abc and abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 and -abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. Arrange that a
leading or trailing - is taken literally.
